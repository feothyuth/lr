# Full Automation

Since you're using **Claude Code**, just tell me directly:

```
Implement: [YOUR TASK]
```

I will automatically:
1. ✅ Create feature branch
2. ✅ Write code + tests
3. ✅ Run cargo fmt + clippy
4. ✅ Commit changes
5. ✅ Push to GitHub
6. ✅ Provide PR summary

## Example:

**You say:**
```
Implement: add exponential backoff to WebSocket reconnection
```

**I do everything automatically** - no scripts needed!

---

## For Review (also automatic):

**You say:**
```
Review the changes in feature/websocket-backoff
```

**I will:**
1. ✅ Get the diff
2. ✅ Check for issues
3. ✅ Suggest fixes
4. ✅ Apply fixes if you approve

---

## That's it!

No scripts, no copy-paste. Just tell me what you want in plain English.

**Fully automated workflow:**
1. You: "Implement: [task]"
2. Me: *implements, tests, commits, pushes*
3. You: "Review it"
4. Me: *reviews and suggests fixes*
5. You: "Looks good"
6. Me: *merges or you merge via GitHub*
